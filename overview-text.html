          The Ramanujan Mathematical Society (RMS) was founded in 1985 with the
          ostensible purpose of promoting mathematics at all levels. With this
          in view, the Society had been conducting major national and
          international conferences. In addition, the Society had organized
          several regional programs which include Outreach Programs to train
          P.G. and Ph.D. scholars to face NET, SLET and other competitive exams
          with greater confidence, Outreach Programs for undergraduate students,
          compact courses for PG students etc. Through its four publications-
          Journal of the Ramanujan Mathematical Society, Lecture Notes Series,
          Collected works series and the Mathematics Newsletter sponsored by the
          National Board for Higher Mathematics, the Society is doing its best
          for the spread of mathematics at different levels.

        <h5 class="p-0 mt-2 abot-txt-innr">
          CHRIST (Deemed to be University) was born out of the educational
          vision of St. Kuriakose Elias Chavara, an educationist and social
          reformer of the nineteenth century in South India. He founded the
          first Catholic indigenous congregation, Carmelites of Mary Immaculate
          (CMI), in 1831, which administers CHRIST (Deemed to be University).
          Established in 1969 as Christ College, it undertook path-breaking
          initiatives in Indian higher education with the introduction of
          innovative and modern curricula, insistence on academic discipline,
          imparting of Holistic Education, and adoption of global higher
          education practices with the support of creative and dedicated staff.
          The University Grants Commission (UGC) of India conferred Autonomy to
          Christ College in 2004 and identified it as an Institution with
          Potential for Excellence in 2006. In 2008 under Section 3 of the UGC
          Act, 1956, the Ministry of Human Resource Development of the
          Government of India, declared the institution a Deemed to be
          University. One of the first institutions in India to be accredited 
          in 1998 by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC), 
          Government of India, and subsequently in 2004, 2016, 2022. CHRIST
          (deemed to be University) is currently accredited with ‘A+’ Grade.
